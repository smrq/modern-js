- Talk about Node.js: a little background, history
- Show a Node.js REPL
	1+1
	"abc"+1
	"abc"-1
- Something that would never work in a browser
	hello world with fs

- Cool, but how does this help us web developers?
- Build systems!

Browserify
- The situation:
	- Dozens and dozens of *.js files
	- Potentially complex dependencies between files
	- Everything sticks stuff on window
- For the Angular-savvy
	- DI solves a lot of this
	- Code is only reusable within Angular apps
	- Magic strings only resolved at runtime
- Browserify elegantly handles file concatenation along with dependency resolution
	- Robot therapist in Node
	- Browserify build.js
	- Run server.js (don't have to explain this)
	- Robot therapist in the browser
- Browserify gets you more than just local module resolution
	- Resolve modules from npm
	- Even resolve some modules from the Node runtime
	- hello world with brfs
- Write your own source transformations!
	- varlessify

Gulp
- Build script is starting to get unwieldy and it doesn't even do much yet
- Convert to gulpfile
- Add minification, server
- Split apart
